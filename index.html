            <h2 class="centered">False Expectations</h2>
            <p>Generally when people are told about their Carbon Footprint, they are told that it's the individuals
                responsibility to reduce emissions and stop climate change. But the truth is: <a class="link" href="https://www.activesustainability.com/climate-change/100-companies-responsible-71-ghg-emissions/?_adin=02021864894">
                71% of global emissions come from just 100 companies</a>. It is also true that despite the United States
                having 1/4 the population of china, <a class='link' href="https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/">
                it's carbon emissions are only half of Chinas</a>. An individual can make a difference
                by reducing emissions, but it shouldn't be a reason to ignore the bigger problems ahead.

            <h2>The Effects of Transportation</h2>
            <p>In the modern United States, travelling is a huge issue. It is made to be almost impossible to simply walk
                to the store. Infrastructure around cars has caused large gaps between places and so having a car is made 
                essiential for many. This is a huge problem though, as pollution via cars easily stacks up the more you have
                to drive. <a class="link" href="https://movotiv.com/statistics#:~:text=More%20than%2086%25%20of%20U.S.%20households%20have%20at%20least%20one%20car%20for%20every%20driver%20in%20the%20home%20and%2028%25%20report%20having%20more%20cars%20than%20drivers.">
                AAA reports that more than 86% of U.S. households have at least one car for every driver in the home and 28% 
                report having more cars than drivers.</a> This begs the question: What can we do about this?

            <h2>One Third of the Picture</h2>
            <p>When talking about reduction of waste, one mutual thought is brought between everyone: recycling. but it is 
            often forgotten that Recycling is the third step of a 3 part plan. The key to reducing waste isn't just recycling,
            but instead Reducing, Reusing, and Recycling.
