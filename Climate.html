            <h2>Deception</h2>
            <p>In 2004, the worlds first 'Carbon Footprint Calculator' was first created and revealed.
            The company behind it? British Petroleum. Today, the term is established into our normal language,
            even as far as <a class="link" href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/carbon-footprint">
            being in our dictionary</a>. The problem is, this term is used only to take the blame away from
            corporations and place it in the hands of the people. Companies like British Petroleum (BP) want you
            to believe that if every individual stopped their carbon emissions, then all would be good. So what 
            if we actually did? Well it turns out we have all the evidence we need, thanks to 2020 and a global
            pandemic. 
            </p>
            <p>While the new COVID-19 was ravaging the streets of the world and more and more people were forced 
            to stop driving to work, quarentine, and stay home; <a href="https://magazine.caltech.edu/post/atmospheric-co2-covid-pandemic" class="link">
            carbon emissions didn't change even a bit</a>.

            <h2>How much companies effect climate change</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>71% of Industrial Emissions are from just 100 companies</li>
                <li>ExxonMobil is responsible for 17% of that</li>
                <li>The top 15 food and beverage companies emit more than all of Australia</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An individual only effects the climate on an astronomically small scale that is unrivaled
            by the biggest of polluters that don't want you to know about it. It is our job to make sure that
            they know we want them to better themselves and work together for a better future.
